# MIT EVT Battery Design

Hello! Welcome to the MIT EVT battery design repository. This is where we compile all our battery CAD files, test data, tools that we have developed, thermal simulations, and more than we use for battery design and development. 

- **Media** simply contains images we have used in various resources
- **Tools** contains python/MATLAB scripts for various engineering that needs to be done for batteries including impedance matching, and more.
- **Mechanical-CAD** contains step files of various batteries
- **Documentation** contains battery design reports, and other helpful documentation
